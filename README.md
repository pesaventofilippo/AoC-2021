# AoC-2021
My solutions for the 2021 edition of Advent of Code.

## Disclaimers
- I'll usually publish my solutions around a day after the problem got published, given that in the first 24h there may be competitions active about who solves a problem first.

- My solutions are not perfect, neither pretty: I want to use this as a training for the Italian Problem Solving olympics, so it's far more important to write an algorithm that works on the fly instead of spending time researching the prettiest way to do it.
